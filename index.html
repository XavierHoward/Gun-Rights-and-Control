Gun rights and gun control are very controversial topics and problems that are brought up in today’s age. The issue is caused by all the violence that people do with guns. The second amendment states,  “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed”. That basically means people owning guns is necessary for our free state, and people have the right to own and keeps guns without them being taken away. Obviously over many years guns rights have been restricted to help protect people from people that want to cause harm with them. These are important and can be kept and grown apon but guns are very important to our country. They are important because they keep power from the government, they prevent criminals from commiting crimes, and actually reduce the number of shootings.

Our founding fathers created the second amendment to prevent the government from taking the power from the people. They saw what a tyrant government was like and they use the second amendment to prevent that from happening to the United States government. According to Ammo.com, “ The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting, it's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs… 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms”. The term history repeats itself is often used, the second amendment is there to keep that from happening. We all don't want to live in a country that takes away its freedom from its people.

	People often think guns are the cause of crimes but it actually is the opposite. According to a study by the United States Department of Justice, “80 percent of felons claimed that they intentionally avoid victims and homes that they believe may be armed” (United States Department of Justice). The same study also said, “One in three criminals has been deterred because of an armed citizen” (United States Department of Justice). Guns give people power, which is good from a crime standpoint. If a criminal has a gun and there are no armed citizens then that criminal has lots of power and is able to carry out the crime until police get there, which could mean dozens of people dying. If there is an armed citizen that is able to disable the perpetrator that could prevent those dozens of people from dying.

	Shootings often happen in places where a large group of people are that are unprotected. Restricting guns will actually create more crime. According to Ammo.com, “In 1997, Wales and England saw a nearly 50 percent increase in homicides immediately after implementing a ban on handguns” (Ammo.com). According to an article, “guns in the United States are used 80 times more often to prevent crime than they are to take lives” (defendandcarry.com). This shows how guns control crime. The problem with banning guns is people that use guns for crime are already committing crimes, so why would a gun ban keep them from using and having a gun. Banning guns would just enable criminals to more easily commit crimes.

	In conclusion, guns are needed to keep power from the government,  prevent criminals from commiting crimes, and actually reduce the number of shootings. Everyone may not agree on the gun control issue but we all can agree that we want to keep the number of mass shooting, murders, and crime as little as possible. Our world is filled with these bad things and needing to protect yourself is needed. In order for us to keep the number of those from growing we need to band together and acknowledge that gun ownership is a very important part of that goal.
